# wics_transfer_2021


This is a copy of a project organized at De Anza College Women in Computer Science Club. We made a webapp to allow current students in computer science to lookup 
where they can transfer to and get a Bachelor in Computer Science. 

I worked on the data, a lot. I also worked on the table page that displays the comparison of up to three schools. The original repository was private, so I'm making this copy here. 

Based on a teacher's recommendation, we started with web2py. That didn't go far, but then they said flask. I wanted to use Django. Another person wanted React. Flask won.

Group members included: Leilasr, Dragonaut2014, zabzabdoda, myself(goode8) and another offline user. Thanks to everyone for their hard work and dedication!
